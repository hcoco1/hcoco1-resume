# Finally, I did it!! I solved a real-world problem.

Since entering the IT world (one year ago 😊), I have read many articles and blog posts about how coding can solve real-world problems. Writing code and building an app that helps others succeed in a role or achieve a goal should be gratifying.

Some bloggers and influencers on LinkedIn and YouTube recommend using the phrase " I want to solve real-world problems through coding" in your resume or behavioral interviews. They say that using that kind of expressions helps you get attention from recruiters 👩‍💼. So, we must consider that if we want to get our first job!

After learning <a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/" target="_blank">how to build full-stack applications</a>, I  became obsessed with creating "something" to solve "something else" through coding. Honestly, after a while, I felt disappointed because many experienced developers had solved almost everything 🤨! Also, artificial intelligence supports everybody in creating websites, web apps, images, logos, blog posts, essays, etc. So, I quit 😒; I stopped my search for creating a useful app.

Why was I looking to solve someone else's problems? The pressure to create a tremendous web application to add to my portfolio and help me get my first job distracted me and confused my mind.

Time passed, and a circumstance at work pointed to a realization that led to a solution. One day, while walking through the warehouse at my job, I had my laptop, pocket notebook, pen, and several sheets of paper for taking notes. After engaging with and coaching several employees, I needed help remembering where I left my pen, pocket notebook, or other item. It wasn't the first time I had forgotten my belongings in various places, but it was the moment I recognized the need for a solution.

Could it be possible? I think so! I have a problem to solve and can code to solve it. I couldn't wait to arrive home to start outlining the app. I recall that at some point, I thought, " Wait a minute, it's a to-do list. Oh no, my very first tremendous app can't be a to-do list." Web developers know that a to-do list is the most used app in tutorials, books, blog posts, etc 🥴. It means that every web developer has built a to-do list at some point. " I want to build something different to a to-do list," I wondered.

The phrase " I want to solve real-world problems through coding" kept appearing in my mind. I thought, "The critical point is to solve a problem or a situation, and it doesn't matter if it is a to-do list." Solving a problem using effortless tools is fascinating and something I am proud of.

After a challenging outline process, the Audits Tool 🦾 was born. It is a taking notes app that allows users to input audit details such as usernames, process paths, and audit descriptions, which are then saved locally and can be viewed or deleted. Additionally, the app offers a feature to generate and download comprehensive audit reports.

**I am proud of this app because I use it, and it works great! I am still testing it and will add new features to improve the user experience. So, finally, I did it 😏. I created a web application and solved a real-world problem.**

>I am still waiting 🕜 for my first IT job, but I am exploring other fields, like <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2024-02-28-cloud-computing" target="_blank">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2024-02-18-cyber-career" target="_blank">Cybersecurity</a>, to expand my career options and acquire cloud and security skills.
