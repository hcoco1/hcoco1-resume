### Introduction to My Coding Journey

Greetings, technology enthusiasts! Today, I am delighted to present a narrative connecting programming and practical problem resolution. This blog post is for everyone interested in technology, especially those just beginning to navigate the expansive web development domain.

### Coding for Real-World Solutions

<a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2023-02-01-changing-careers" target="_blank">Since entering the IT world (one year ago)</a>, I have read many articles and blog posts about how coding can solve real-world problems. Writing code and building an app that helps others succeed in a role or achieve a goal should be gratifying.

Some bloggers and influencers on LinkedIn and YouTube recommend using the phrase "I want to solve real-world problems through coding" in your resume or behavioral interviews. They say that using those expressions helps you get attention from recruiters.

### The Reality of Coding Solutions

After learning <a href="https://flatironschool.com/courses/coding-bootcamp/" target="_blank">how to build full-stack applications</a>, I  became obsessed with creating "something" to solve "something else" through coding. Initially, I found myself disheartened. I plunged into the world of coding with dreams of crafting innovative solutions, only to discover that seasoned developers had already tackled many challenges I faced. Also, artificial intelligence supports everybody in creating websites, web apps, images, logos, blog posts, essays, etc. The question that tormented me was, 'What unique contribution could I offer?' This period of introspection led me to the brink of abandoning my quest to create something meaningful through coding.

### Reevaluating My Goals

>Why was I looking to solve someone else's problems? 
>>This question remained in my mind, echoing my frustrations. Upon reflection, I realized I was approaching the problem from the wrong angle. My desire to create wasn't just about solving any problem but finding a challenge that resonated with me. It was about using my unique perspective and skills to contribute in a way that only I could.

### From Disappointment to Inspiration: Finding My Project

However, this phase of doubt was not the end but a necessary journey toward a deeper understanding of my goals and capabilities. Time passed, and a circumstance at work pointed to a realization that led to a solution. One day, while walking through the warehouse at my job, I had my laptop, pocket notebook, pen, and several sheets of paper for taking notes. After engaging with and coaching several employees, I needed help remembering where I left my pen, pocket notebook, or other item. It wasn't the first time I had forgotten my belongings in various places, but it was the moment I recognized the need for a solution.

>This might seem trivial to some, but it highlighted a gap, a personal inconvenience that I realized could be addressed through the skills I was questioning.

### Introducing the Audits Tool: My Solution to a Real-World Problem

The phrase " I want to solve real-world problems through coding" kept appearing. I thought, "The critical point is to solve a problem or a situation, and it doesn't matter if it is a to-do list." Solving a problem using effortless tools is fascinating and something I am proud of. Thus, I shifted my focus from seeking grandiose projects to identifying and tackling real, tangible issues I encountered.

After a challenging outline process, the <a href="https://audits.hcoco1.com/" target="_blank">Audits Tool</a> was born, a project that, while seemingly modest, represented a significant milestone in my development journey. Audits Tool is a taking notes app that allows users to input audit details such as usernames, process paths, and audit descriptions, which are then saved locally and can be viewed or deleted. Additionally, the app offers a feature to generate and download comprehensive audit reports.

### Pride and Progress: The Journey of the Audits Tool

I take great pride in this app, not just because I use it daily, but because it stands as a testament to the power of simple solutions to enhance productivity. I am still testing it and will add new features to improve the user experience. Also, I plan to migrate the Audits Tool to the AWS platform and add features like authentication and a database.

This narrative reminds aspiring developers to consider their everyday experiences as potential opportunities to apply their skills. It underscores the idea that the problems we often overlook could lead to meaningful achievements.

So, finally, I did it 😏. I created a web application and solved a real-world problem.

### Expanding Horizons: Stepping Into AWS and Cybersecurity

>My journey through the development of all my projects refined my technical skills and ignited a curiosity about the landscape of technology. This exploration led me to recognize the importance of security and infrastructure, particularly in the era of <a href="https://digitalcloud.training/cloud-mastery-bootcamp/?megamenu" target="_blank">cloud computing</a>. This realization propelled me to expand my expertise in <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2024-02-28-cloud-computing" target="_blank">AWS</a> and <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2024-02-18-cyber-career" target="_blank">Cybersecurity</a> to expand my career options and acquire cloud and security skills. As I continue to seek my first IT job, my incursion into these areas is more than just a diversification of skills—it's a strategic step towards becoming a well-rounded tech professional capable of addressing the multifaceted challenges of today's digital world.
