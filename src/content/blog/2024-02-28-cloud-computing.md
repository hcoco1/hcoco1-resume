**Hey there! ðŸš€ It's been a while since my last post, but I'm back with some exciting news I can't wait to share with you all. I've been on an incredible journey diving into the world of AWS, and I'm eager to take you along with me!**

 After graduating with a certification as a Software Engineer, I started exploring other fields like <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/blog/2024-02-18-career-simulation-1" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> and cloud computing. I am writing this post to share my starting journey through the AWS world with all of you. 

Recently, I enrolled in the <a href="https://digitalcloud.training/cloud-mastery-bootcamp/?megamenu" target="_blank">Cloud Mastery Bootcamp</a> to acquire cloud computing skills and  earn five cloud certifications: 
* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>
* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate</a>
* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Developer Associate</a>
* <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate" target="_blank">HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate</a>
* <a href="https://learn.digitalcloud.training/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-real-world" target="_blank">Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)</a>

The Cloud Mastery Bootcamp provides training for a broad set of cloud job roles including Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Solutions Architect. *<small>(Digital Cloud Training, 2024)</small>*. I expect to advance in my <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/cv" target="_blank">professional career</a> and get a position as a cloud professional.

**Cloud Foundations and Linux** training is the first module of the Bootcamp, and it provides a pretty excellent overview of the following topics:

**Cloud Computing and AWS:** Cloud computing delivers services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, and software. AWS, a leader in the market, offers IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS solutions, enabling organizations to scale operations with on-demand resources and pay-as-you-go models *<small>(What-is-cloud-computing, n.d.)</small>*.

**Compute and Storage Services:** AWS provides compute options like EC2 for virtual servers, Lambda for serverless computing, and ECS for containerized workloads. Storage solutions include S3, offering scalable and secure object storage *<small>(What-is-cloud-computing, n.d.)</small>*.

**Amazon Linux:** Amazon Linux offers stable, secure, high-performance AWS application environments. Versions include Amazon Linux 2023 and Amazon Linux 2, both optimized for cloud and enterprise applications.
High Availability and Elasticity: AWS ensures high availability and elasticity through features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance mechanisms, enabling resilient architectures and optimal performance *<small>(What-is-cloud-computing, n.d.)</small>*.

**Serverless Applications:** AWS Lambda allows developers to run code without managing servers, offering scalability, cost-efficiency, and agility for event-driven and microservices-based applications.
Networking Fundamentals and VPC: AWS offers networking services, including Amazon VPC, enabling organizations to create isolated network environments with control over IP addressing, subnets, and security groups for secure and scalable architectures *<small>(What-is-cloud-computing, n.d.)</small>*.

**Deployment and Management:** AWS provides management tools like AWS Management Console, CLI, and CloudFormation for efficient deployment, configuration, and monitoring of infrastructure and applications, optimizing performance and reducing operational overhead *<small>(What-is-cloud-computing, n.d.)</small>*.

I am so excited about learning all these AWS applications. The first thing that came to my mind when I learned about AWS applications was to migrate <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/portfolio" target="_blank">all my web apps and web pages</a> to AWS. So,  I am anxious to start the Developer Associate module to migrate and create websites and web applications using AWS services. One project that's been on my mind is deploying my <a href="https://www.hcoco1.com/portfolio/database-tool" target="_blank">Python command-line interface project</a> using Docker containers on AWS.

#### **<span style="color:green"> In short, enrolling in the Cloud Mastery Bootcamp and pursuing five AWS cloud certifications signifies my commitment to advancing in the Cloud Computing field. Through ongoing learning and practical experience, I aim to become a successful cloud professional, making meaningful contributions to the cloud computing field.**
