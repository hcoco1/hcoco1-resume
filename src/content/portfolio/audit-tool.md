# Core Functionalities (AI-Generated ðŸ¤–)

## State Management with React Hooks

### useState Hook

- Utilized for initializing and managing the component's state, enabling tracking of the todos list, new todo input fields, auditor's name, and the editing state of the auditor's name.
- Facilitates local state management within functional components, essential for dynamically handling user inputs and application data.

## Component Composition and Reusability

### Child Components

- Integrates reusable child components (`TodoForm`, `TodoList`, `Footer`, `ReportGenerator`, and `AuditorNameForm`), highlighting React's component composition model for a modular and maintainable codebase.

## Event Handling and State Updates

### Form Submission

- Processes new todo additions and auditor name submissions via form submission handlers, preventing default form behavior and updating the state with new data.


## Deployment and Custom Domain Configuration

GitHub Pages: Utilized for its simplicity in deploying static sites directly from a GitHub repository, offering a streamlined workflow for pushing updates and managing releases.

Custom Subdomain Configuration: Involves setting a CNAME record in GoDaddyâ€™s DNS settings to point the chosen subdomain (audits.hcoco1.com) to the GitHub Pages URL. This process exemplifies domain management and the integration of external DNS services with GitHub-hosted projects.
